A simple and modern counter application built using **React** and **Redux**. This app demonstrates state management using Redux and provides a user-friendly interface with interactive buttons.

## Features

- Increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.
- Modern and minimalist design with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Uses Redux for global state management.
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes.
